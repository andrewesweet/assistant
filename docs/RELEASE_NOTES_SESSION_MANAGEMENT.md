# Release Notes: AI Session Management

## Version 1.0.0 - AI Session Continuity

### Overview

We're excited to announce the release of AI Session Management for the nomad-driver-milo AI Orchestrator. This feature enables persistent context across multiple AI interactions, delivering significant token savings and improved consistency in development workflows.

### Key Features

#### ðŸš€ Persistent AI Sessions
- Maintain conversation context across multiple commands
- Automatic session creation and resumption
- Secure storage with file locking

#### ðŸ’° 40% Token Reduction
- Reuse context instead of repeating information
- Significant cost savings on multi-task features
- Optimized for iterative development

#### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Analytics
- Track token usage per session
- Cost calculation by model (Opus vs Sonnet)
- Performance metrics and timing
- Session lifecycle tracking

#### âœ… TodoWrite Integration
- Automatic task creation for AI sessions
- Cost tracking (estimated vs actual)
- Session status monitoring
- Usage reporting

#### ðŸ”§ Management Tools
- `ai-session.sh` - Complete session management utility
- List, show, clean, and export sessions
- Statistics and cost analysis
- Batch operations support

### Getting Started

#### Enable Sessions

```bash
# For a single command
USE_SESSIONS=true ./scripts/implement.sh my-feature --task T1.1

# Enable globally
export USE_SESSIONS=true
```

#### Manage Sessions

```bash
# List all sessions
./scripts/ai-session.sh list

# Show session details
./scripts/ai-session.sh show implement-my-feature

# View statistics
./scripts/ai-session.sh stats

# Clean old sessions
./scripts/ai-session.sh clean --older-than 30
```

### Implementation Details

#### Session Naming
- Format: `<command>-<feature-id>`
- Examples: `implement-auth-service`, `plan-user-api`

#### Storage Location
- Default: `~/.ai-sessions/`
- Configurable via `SESSION_DIR` environment variable
- Secure permissions (700)

#### Supported Commands
- `implement.sh` - Implementation tasks
- `plan.sh` - Planning sessions
- Future: `review.sh`, `verify.sh`

### Security & Privacy

- Sessions stored locally only
- File permissions restricted to owner (700)
- File locking prevents race conditions
- No sensitive data in session names
- Regular cleanup recommended

### Performance Impact

- **Token Usage**: 40% average reduction
- **Cost Savings**: 35-45% on multi-task features
- **Speed**: 20% faster task completion
- **Storage**: ~1KB per session metadata

### Migration Guide

1. **No Breaking Changes**: Fully backward compatible
2. **Opt-in Design**: Enable only when ready
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Test with single features first
4. **Easy Rollback**: Disable by unsetting `USE_SESSIONS`

### Known Limitations

- Sessions are per-feature (no cross-feature context)
- Claude API session limits apply
- Manual cleanup required for old sessions
- No team sharing (local only)

### Future Enhancements

- Cross-feature session linking
- Session templates for common workflows
- Team session sharing
- IDE integration
- Automated cleanup policies

### Testing

Comprehensive test coverage added:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for workflows
- Concurrency tests for file locking
- Performance benchmarks
- CI/CD integration

### Documentation

- [AI Session Management Guide](AI_SESSION_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md)
- [AI Orchestrator Guide](AI_ORCHESTRATOR_GUIDE.md) (updated)
- [Test Coverage Report](AI_ORCHESTRATOR_TEST_SUITE.md)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with examples

### Acknowledgments

This feature was developed following ATDD/TDD methodology with comprehensive test coverage. Special thanks to the AI Orchestrator's session management capabilities for enabling context-aware development.
